Here's a generic SPARQL query designed to detect inconsistencies where a successful Windows logon event exists for a user (e.g., john.doe), but no matching profile folder exists under C:\Users\.

This query assumes:

Logon events are modeled using a custom facet (acme:WindowsLogonEventFacet) with acme:accountName.
User profile directories are represented as uco-observable:Directory with paths under C:\Users\.

    # Normalize and check path match
    FILTER regex(?path, CONCAT("^C:\\\\Users\\\\", ?accountName, "$"), "i")
  }
}
üí° Result
This query returns usernames that:

Had a successful logon (eventID = 4624).
But don‚Äôt have a matching C:\Users\<username> directory.
Would you like a version that also checks for partial folder matches like C:\Users\john.doe.DOMAIN?

üß† What This Detects
Finds users listed in the registry account list (under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SAM\...).
Checks if their profile directory is missing under C:\Users\.
Flags those usernames as inconsistent.
Would you like to combine this with the previous query to detect users who had either a logon event or were present in the registry, but had no corresponding profile directory?

üîç What This Catches
Any ?username that is:
Logged on (event 4624), or
Present in the registry key path
But does not have a C:\Users\?username directory.
Let me know if you want to expand this to handle:

Case-insensitive folder matches,
Domain-qualified usernames (e.g., john.doe.DOMAIN),
Timestamps for when logons occurred vs. expected profile creation.
